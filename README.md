 1. General description of the game:
"Pig" is a game played by 2 players. Points for per player are gained when the he/she throws a dice.
For example if player1 throws "6" it means that he has 6 points for now.
Player can throw as many times as he/she wants, so he/she can stack his points.
However when he/she throws "1". His/her turn ends and points that were gained from this turn are reset.
Then is the turn for the next player.
A player can choose to hold his/her hand whenever he/she wants during a turn.
Winner is the player who first reaches 100 points.

2. Implementation:
We run the game from Main.py file. This is the "foundation point" which calls another file
in which user passes an argument. Based on the argument the program sets the current game mode(single/multiplayer)
Next file that is run is either singleplayer.py/multiplayer.py.
This is where most of the heavy lifting goes. All of the game logic is in these two files.

- for singleplayer.py:
Here the player is vs the computer.
Setting up bot difficulty is achieved by calling a method("set_bot_level") of instance 'bot'.
This method asks the user for the desired level for the bot to be.
After the input the code sets a randomised number which will represent the times that the bot will throw dice until it decides to hold a hand.
Example:
If the player chooses "normal" level game. It means that bot will throw from 1 to 3 (random int in range (1-3)) times per turn.
Bot's turn itself is an automated one, simply calling roll method of class "Dice" after each player's turn.
If level difficulty is set to "hard". It means that bot will throw from 5 to 8 (random int in range (5-8)) times per turn.

- for multiplayer.py
 player is vs another real player.
 Here the turns are not automated -> each player has to pass arguments to the console in order to make anything during a turn.
